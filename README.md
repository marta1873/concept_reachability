# Concept Reachability

This is the code repository for Concept Reachability in Diffusion Models. To run the code it is required to first generate the train data for the diffusion model (see [generate_dataset.py](./generate_dataset.py)). The original balanced dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1je8rXTlkerypXLcj5NPMAV_Y3JgDCahE?usp=share_link). Configuration dicts used in the different experiments below are provided in [experiment_1.py](./experiment_1.py), [experiment_2.py](./experiment_2.py), [experiment_3.py](./experiment_3.py) and [experiment_4.py](./experiment_4.py) respectively.


## Experiment 1: Balanced dataset

## Experiment 2: Scarcity of Concepts

## Experiment 3: Underspecification of Captions

## Experiment 4: Biases
